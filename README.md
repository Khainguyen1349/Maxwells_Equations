# Maxwell

To fully understand the marvels of Maxwell's equations, I deep-dived into the mathematical aspects of it throughout different case studies. 

## Cavity mode 
Let's start with the most basic example. This might help you "see" the physical phenomenon of the mathematical equations.

The first thing one may need to understand is the notion of an eigenstate (eigenvector) and an eigenvalue. It can be clear from the mathematical expressions that the eigenvector **x** and its corresponding eigenvalue &lambda; of a matrix  **A** verify **Ax** = &lambda;**x**. This means that the modifications (scale, stretch, and rotation) defined by the matrix **A** on the state **v**, defined by the parameters in the vector, do nothing special but scale the vector by a factor &lambda;.

Try to remember this **A** is the function/equation, **v** is the state. In the context of an electromagnetic field, **A** is the system defined by Maxwell's equations, and the eigen-states **v**(s) are the electric fields (Efield) and magnetic fields (Hfield). In a closed system, e.g., in a cavity with a closed border with Perfect Electrical/Magnetic Condition, the total E-/H-field can be decomposed into _discrete_ eigen-E-/H-fields.

To visualize two of the eigenstates, I have plotted as follows.
